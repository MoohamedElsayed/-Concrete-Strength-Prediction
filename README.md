## Dataset Description
There are Various Factors that affects the Strength of Concrete Such as Materials Used, Age etc.  


### Input variables :  
1- CementComponent:- Amount of cement is mixed  
2- BlastFurnaceSlag:- Amount of Blast Furnace Slag is mixed   
3- FlyAshComponent:- Amount of FlyAsh is mixed  
4- WaterComponent:- Amount of water is mixed   
5- SuperplasticizerComponent:- Amount of Super plasticizer is mixed  
6- CoarseAggregateComponent:- Amount of Coarse Aggregate is mixed    
7- FineAggregateComponent:- Amount of Coarse Aggregate is mixed  
8- AgeInDays:- How many days it was left dry  

## Output variable :  
9- Strength:- What was the final strength of concrete- (Target) 


## Objective:  
Understand the Dataset & cleanup.    
Predict the Strength of the Concrete Based on the Components and Other Factors as Predictors.  
Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various algorithms.
